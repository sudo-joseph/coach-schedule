This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Got it! Here's an updated **README** assuming you're a new user joining the project, and the setup steps are already complete. It will guide you on how to get started with the project and begin working on it.

# Getting Started with the Project

This guide will walk you through the steps to get the project up and running locally, assuming the initial setup has already been done.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Make sure you have a `.env` file in the root of the project. If not, create one by copying from `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Step 4: Run Prisma Migrations

Since Prisma migrations are already set up, you need to run them to ensure your local database is up-to-date.

Run the following command to apply migrations:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

Generate the prisma client: 
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

Seed the database: 
```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

## Step 5: Start the Application

Run the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Step 7: Working with Prisma

If you need to make changes to the database schema, follow these steps:

1. Modify the `prisma/schema.prisma` file to define new models or update existing ones.
2. Generate a new migration to reflect those changes:

    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev --name your-migration-name
    ```

3. Apply the migration and regenerate Prisma Client:

    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    npx prisma generate
    ```

## Step 8: Running Tests (Optional)

If the project has tests set up, you can run them to verify everything is working properly.

Using **npm**:

```bash
npm run test
```

Or using **Yarn**:

```bash
yarn test
```

Thatâ€™s it! You should now be set up and ready to start working on the project. If you have any questions about the project structure or need help with specific tasks, feel free to reach out!
